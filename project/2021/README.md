# Project - 2021 SM2

### Project Overview

In this subject, we will discuss a variety of design principles and architectural patterns for enterprise applications. In this project, students will have the opportunity to gain practical experience in the implementation of these patterns by developing a large-scale enterprise application. 

The project aims to give students the experience to:
*	Produce an architectural design for an enterprise system.
*	Choose suitable design patterns to be applied for the different architectural layers.
*	Implement an application for your design. 
*	Develop employability skills: teamwork, good communication, collaboration, problem-solving, critical-thinking, adaptability, initiative and leadership.
