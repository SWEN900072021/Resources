# Part 2 - Instructions for Demonstration

Live demonstrations for Part 2 of the project will take place in Week 9 (Monday and Thursday). Each team will have 30 minutes to demonstrate their application and their implementation of the patterns in a private session with a tutor (demonstrations will take place via Zoom with waiting room enabled).

## Demo registration

**You must sign up** for the live demonstrations here: [Demo Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz8-gQLTFfpX9TnJhfiQnTiEci6NkgYd0yskBVt2-c/edit?usp=sharing) (please get this organized by the end of Week 8 - **make sure you use your @student.unimelb.edu.au email to access the spreadsheet**)

Choose a time slot that works for your team. Allocations are on a first come first serve basis. You can choose any time slot, it does not have to be from the tutorial you are enrolled in.

At least one team member must attend the demo session, however, all team members are strongly encouraged to attend as marks will be given based on the functionality shown during the demo and explanations/code samples shown to demonstrate the implementation of the patterns.

## What to expect from the demo session

The live demo is intended as an interactive meeting between the team and the tutor, where the team gets to show, explain, and demonstrate what they have implemented, for marking purposes. The team is expected to show a working application deployed on Heroku (or an alternative hosting platform that allows tutors to remotely access your application), highlight for which use case(s) each pattern has been implemented, and show and explain the implementation of each of the patterns.

Specifically, each team is expected to:

- [ ]	Have the **application deployed and running**.
- [ ]	Show that the deployed application corresponds to the release tag for part 2. 
- [ ]	**Demonstrate the applicationâ€™s functionality** based on the agreed use cases. This includes allowing the tutor to give you instructions on how to navigate through your application and allowing the tutor to directly access and use your application.
- [ ]	Be prepared to answer questions regarding the design, functionality, and implementation of the patterns.
- [ ]	Have the **code available** to show to the tutor.
Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any further questions.
