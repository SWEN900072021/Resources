This guide gives you an overview of the tools you will use during development (TomCat, Heroku, Maven, etc.). It also provides 
a walk-through guide to creating your first Servlet and JSP, passing parameters between Servlets and JSPs, and querying
your application's database.

### [Introduction to Maven](maven.md)

This guide gives you an overview of the build tool we will use this semester - Maven. It introduces Maven and how it
specifies projects using the POM file, as well as how to add dependencies in your project.

## [Tools and Plugins](tools_and_plugins.md)

Some of the teaching team's favourite tools and plugins for IntelliJ to help you as you complete your project.
